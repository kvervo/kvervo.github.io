Mango is coming out soon, so I finally updated the [HorizontalLoopingSelector control][1] for the Mango version of the Toolkit.

As always the [sample project][2] is available on github or you can download the [package][3] containing only the modified files that need to be added to **Microsoft.Phone.Controls.Toolkit** folder.

If you have any comments or question, please leave them in the comments section.

Enjoy!
