Hi everyone! 

Has been a long time since I published something here. So, I am trying to make a comeback.
I have some posts ideas which I need to polish and finish writing. 

But meanwhile, allow me to introduce [ElectoG Calendar](1).

If you are like me and:
- use Google G Suite for work purposes
- do not like to have multiple tabs open in your browser
- got used to having a separate email/calendar app (e.g. Outlook) but do not like the default apps on your standard OS of choice.

Then look no further, Electro-G is an Electron wrapper around [Google Calendar](3).

I wanted to check what [Electron](2) was about and decided to use it in solving this usability issue I had.

Hope, somebody finds it helpful.
