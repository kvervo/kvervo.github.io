Hi everyone! 

Has been a long time since I did not publish anything here. So, I am trying to make a come back.

Have some posts ideas which I need to polish and finish writting. 

But meanwhile, allow me to introduce: [ElectoG](1)

If you are like me:
- have to use Google G Suite for work purposes
- do not like to have multiple tabs open
- got used to have a separate email/calendar app (e.g. Outlook, etc) but do not like the default apps on your standard OS of choice.

Then look no further Electro-G is an Electron wrapper around Google Calendar.

I wanted to check what Electron is and decided to use it to solving this usability issue I had.

!! CONCLUSION !!
