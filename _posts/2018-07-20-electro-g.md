Hi everyone! 

Has been a long time since I published something here. So, I am trying to make a comeback.

I have some posts ideas which I need to polish and finish writing. 

But meanwhile, allow me to introduce ElectoG Calendar.

If you are like me and:

- use Google G Suite for work
- do not like to have multiple tabs open in your browser
- got used to having a separate email/calendar app (e.g. Outlook) but do not like the default apps on your standard OS of choice.

Then look no further, Electro-G is an Electron wrapper around Google Calendar.

I wanted to check what Electron was about and decided to use it in solving this usability issue I had.

Hope, somebody finds it helpful.
